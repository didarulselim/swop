Cookies are small files of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on web pages or in emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our Website and Services. We use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and similar technologies (collectively “Cookies”) to collect information about your browsing activities and to distinguish you from other users of our Services. This aids your experience when you use our Services and also allows us to improve the functionality of our Services. When you use our Services, we collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as Cookies and browser analysis tools. In many cases, the information we collect using Cookies and other tools is used in a non-identifiable way, without any reference to personal data. We may use Cookies to make our Website usage more efficient and to tailor your browsing preferences and improve the functionality of our Website. Cookies can be used for performance management, collecting information on how our Website is being used for analytics purposes. They can also be used for functionality management, enabling us to make the user’s visit more efficient by, for example, remembering language preferences, passwords and log-in details. Below is an overview of the types of Cookies that we and third parties may use to collect Personal Information. ● Strictly necessary cookies. Some Cookies are strictly necessary to make our Services available to you. We cannot provide you with our Services without this type of cookie. For example, these cookies allow us to provide the login functionality. ● Functional cookies. These Cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our Services. This enables us to adapt our content for you, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). ● Analytical or Performance cookies. We also use Cookies for website and app analytics purposes in order to operate, maintain and improve our Services. We may use our own analytics Cookies or use third party analytics providers such as Google tag manager, to collect and process certain analytics data on our behalf. These providers may also collect information about your use of other websites, apps, and online resources. You can opt out of Google tag manager without affecting how you visit our Services by going to tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or via Google’s Ads settings. Where required by applicable law, we obtain your consent to use Cookies. You can find more information about your rights and choices, and how to block the use of certain Cookies in the section Your Rights and Choices below. B. Our Use of European Personal Information.
